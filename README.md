## Assessment Overview
The assessment consists of two parts:

### Part 1: HubSpot OAuth Integration

#### Backend
1. Navigate to the `/backend/integrations` folder.
2. You will find two completed files (`airtable.py` and `notion.py`) and one incomplete file (`hubspot.py`).
3. Complete the following functions in `hubspot.py`:
   - `authorize_hubspot`
   - `oauth2callback_hubspot`
   - `get_hubspot_credentials`
4. Use the structure of the completed integrations (`airtable.py` and `notion.py`) and relevant HubSpot documentation to guide your implementation.

#### Frontend
1. Navigate to `/frontend/src/integrations`.
2. You will find two existing integration files (`airtable.js` and `notion.js`) and an empty file for the HubSpot integration (`hubspot.js`).
3. Complete `hubspot.js`.
4. Integrate HubSpot into the UI by modifying the necessary files.

**Note:** The AirTable and Notion integrations will not work as the client information has been redacted. Create a **client ID** and **client secret** to test your HubSpot integration. Optionally, you can create your own Notion and AirTable app credentials for additional testing.

### Part 2: Loading HubSpot Items

#### Backend
1. Navigate to `/backend/integrations/hubspot.py`.
2. Complete the `get_items_hubspot` function.
3. This function should:
   - Query HubSpotâ€™s API using credentials obtained from the OAuth flow.
   - Return a list of `IntegrationItem` objects.
   - Determine which fields and endpoints are most relevant for HubSpot (reference `notion.py` and `airtable.py`).

#### Frontend
1. Determine how to display the resulting list of **Integration Items**.
2. A simple approach is to print the final list to the console.

**Note:** Similar to Part 1, the AirTable and Notion integrations will not work as their client information has been redacted. Create a **client ID** and **client secret** to test your HubSpot integration.
