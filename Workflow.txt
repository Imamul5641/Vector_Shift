Workflow For running and Testing the hubspot
1. First i have created a virtual environment to download the resources independently
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate

2. Following that we have gone through frontend directory installing all the dependencies
    and running it.
    cd frontend
    npm i
    npm run dev

3. After that i have gone through the backend directory installing all the dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Many more function such as dotenv,fastapi, httpx and other i have downloaded indiviually

4. After that i have downloaded the redis for running for macOS and start running it.
    brew install redis
    brew services start redis

5. following the above step i took airtable as a base to create hubspot.py.
    Therefore i created airtable app and tested the whole process using the
    CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET

6. I have also set the OAuth redirect URL in Airtable developer portal with the same
    as airtable.py file

7. After getting the workflow first i created the frontend hubsport.js similar to
    airtable.js

8. Also imported hubspot.js in data-form.js and integration-form.js

9. After building the frontend i started building the backend.

10. First i make an app in the hubspot by signing in

11. Copied the code from airtable.py doing some changes so that it work for the hubspot.py

12. I have set the Redirect URI to the following in hubspot developer portal
    http://localhost:8000/integrations/hubspot/oauth2callback

13. To ensure that all the code are running i have all modified the return of
    get_items_hubspot as '[1,2,3]'
